        Hi ${lead.contact.firstName?lower_case?cap_first},
        ${lead.agent.agentFirstName} here from ${lead.office.name} (Service Center). Regarding the ${lead.product.year?c} ${lead.product.model?capitalize} you got in ${lead.deal.purchaseMonthInShortForm} (around ${lead.deal.purchaseOrdinalDay}), I wanted to chat with you about your 1st Scheduled Maintenance even if you have fewer miles than 5000. Is it OK if I text you?

        Prefiere Espanol?

        Thanks, ${lead.contact.firstName}. <#if lead.deal.numberOfMonthsSinceSoldDate??>It's been ${lead.deal.numberOfMonthsSinceSoldDate} since you got your ${lead.product.year?c} ${lead.product.model?capitalize}.</#if> I reached out to remind you about your 1st maintenance service that's due ${lead.deal.descriptiveNextServiceDate}. Even if you have fewer than 5000 miles, this service is recommended every 6 months at no cost.

        Do you want me to schedule this for you, ${lead.contact.firstName}?

        Hey ${lead.contact.firstName},
        I'm just following up again to remind you about your next service maintenance, on your ${lead.product.year?c} ${lead.product.model?capitalize}. If this is not the best time (or if it's early), I can follow up with you later. In case you want to book an appt, all I need is a date & time that works best for you, and I will set it up. I hope that makes it easier. : )

If this is not the best time (or if it's early), I can follow up with you later. In case you want to book an appt, all I need is a date & time that works best for you, and I will set it up.

        It's ${lead.agent.agentFirstName} again. Not sure if you saw the last message I sent you a month ago (on ${lead.deal.lastContactedMonthOrdinalDate}). I may have contacted you too early for the next service appt on your ${lead.product.year?c} ${lead.product.model?capitalize}, I hope now is a better time.

        ${lead.contact.firstName}, It's ${lead.agent.agentFirstName} again. Not sure if you saw the last message I sent you a month ago (on ${lead.deal.lastContactedMonthOrdinalDate}). I may have contacted you too early for the 25k maintenance on your ${lead.product.year?c} ${lead.product.model?capitalize}, I hope now is a better time. If it's easy to set your appt via text, I can help you (unless U prefer to call). Do you want me to schedule it for you?

        Hey ${lead.contact.firstName},

        I'm just checking in to remind you of your 25k service which includes tire rotation, fluid adjustments, multi-point inspection. This service is provided by Toyota Care at no cost to you. If you'd like to set up an appointment, all I need is a date and time that works for you, and I'll take care of the rest.

But the 15K Service also includes services such as tire rotation, fluid level adjustment, and brake inspection and won't cost you anything. Let me know if you would like to set up an appointment.
